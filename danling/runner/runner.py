class Runner(BaseRunner):
    r"""
    Dynamic runner class that selects the appropriate platform based on configuration.

    This runner dynamically changes its class to combine with the appropriate platform
    (torch, accelerate, or deepspeed) based on the 'platform' configuration option.

    Valid platform options are:

    - "auto" (default)
    - "torch"
    - "accelerate"
    - "deepspeed"

    Examples:
        >>> config = Config({"platform": "accelerate"})
        >>> runner = Runner(config)
